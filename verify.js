/**
 * Allows any external auditor or individual to verify
 * that the root stored within the contract matches the 
 * root generated here, which is generated using all of the
 * addresses holding the ERC-721 token at snapshot time. 
 * 
 * @private_comment This means that we are using cryptography
 * to generate a hash that represents an "aggregate" of all 
 * the addresses that are whitelisted in the contract - if
 * an address is missing from the list in wscOwnerAddressesSnapshot.json
 * or if there is an additional address that isn't on the list, the
 * generated hash would be different.
 * 
 * In thi way, the hash is both a constraint and a "proof" as to the 
 * addresss that are allowed to be whitelisted.
